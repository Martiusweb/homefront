I am Martin, and you are visiting my personal webpage.

After 7 years in Paris, I'm now living in Zurich where I work for Google as
**Site Reliability Engineer**.

I am an amateur baker, cook, cyclist and rock climber.

You can learn more `about me <aboutme.html>`_ and my work.

You can contact me:

  * by e-mail: :ob:`ten.bewsuitram@suitram`,
  * on Twitter: `@Martiusweb <https://twitter.com/Martiusweb>`_,
  * on Facebook: `martius <http://facebook.com/martius>`__,

  * or by phone. Please ask me my number by e-mail.

I write code
------------

I spend a significant amount of my time writing code and building things with
computers. My main personal project is
`asynctest <https://github.com/Martiusweb/asynctest>`_, a **Python** library
which simplifies testing of code based on asyncio.

In the `code <code.html>`_ section, you can find a sample of my personal work,
articles I've written and talks I gave.

I'm in read/write mode on:

  * Github: `Martiusweb <https://github.com/Martiusweb>`__,
  * Hacker News: `martius <http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=martius>`__,
  * Stack Overflow: `Martin Richard <https://stackoverflow.com/users/572821/martin-richard>`__.

I enjoy food and beverages
--------------------------

In my spare time, I enjoy baking and cooking. In particular, I bake my bread
weekly. I also like specialty coffee.

I want to collect some recipes and keep a list of my favorite coffee shops.
Everything I share about `food and coffee <food.html>`_ can be found there.

Have a look at my contributions on
`Google Maps <https://maps.app.goo.gl/eL9hsszKkHY5PZcj9>`__.

And other things
----------------

There are many other things I might want to share: playlists on spotify, bike
rides and maps, etc. Everything which is not code or food will fall in the
`Misc <misc.html>`_ section.

I sometimes share stuff:

   * Music I liked on `the Hype Machine <http://hypem.com/martiusweb>`_,
   * Playlists I created on `Spotify <https://open.spotify.com/user/1157433704>`_,
   * Bike rides and maps on `Strava <https://www.strava.com/athletes/14133506>`_.
