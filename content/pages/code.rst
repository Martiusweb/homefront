Everything I write that is not under contract is open-sourced de-facto, since I
put everything on Github. But not everything is worth a look.

Asynctest
---------

`Asynctest <https://github.com/Martiusweb/asynctest>`_ is a library written in
*Python*. It provides utilities for writting tests for software using asyncio.
In particular, it provides mocks for coroutines.

I started this project in 2015 and I am still its main author and maintainer.

I gave two talks about asynctest:

* `FOSDEM 2017 <https://archive.fosdem.org/2017/schedule/event/python_asynctest/>`_
  (available on `YouTube <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lt9fattEiJ0>`__),
* `Pycon FR 2016 (on YouTube) <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdEwixkPhUs>`_.
