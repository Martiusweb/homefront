asynctest is a library which adds features for asyncio to the unittest module,
shipped with Python.

This talk aims at present asynctest and discuss techniques to write unit tests.
We will talk about testing from zero: how to write and run test cases,
structure them (files, classes, methods) in a source repository.

We will also see a few interresting and often overlooked features of unittest.
Then, we will discover how asynctest can help to write tests for asyncio:
mocking of coroutines, simulating the loop and its clock.

Developers which are not familiar with asyncio are welcome: most of the advices
and techniques shown work with the unittest module.
