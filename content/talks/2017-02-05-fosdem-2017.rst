asynctest enhances the standard python package unittest with features for
asyncio. This talk aims at presenting asynctest and discuss various practices
around unit testing of code using asyncio.

This talk aims at presenting asynctest, a library written on top of the
standard unittest module. asynctest provides features for writing tests for
libraries and programs using asyncio.

We will discover handy features like:

  * how ``asynctest.TestCase`` reduces boilerplate and offers safeguards around
    subtle mistakes in an asynchronous code,
  * how ``asynctest.Mock`` objects helps to mock coroutines, and how patch
    decorators are enhanced to handle coroutines,
  * how one can control the event loop's clock.

I will also discuss the future of asynctest and planned features.
