Homefront
=========

Homefront is the new version of my personal website.
It's a static website in Python.

It is based on:

* `Pelican <https://blog.getpelican.com/>_`,
* `Bootstrap` (and its dependencies).

Quickstart
----------

First time, do:

 * set settings.py for festune
 * npm preinstall
 * npm install

npm run-script festune-login to setup spotify credentials (see
Martiusweb/festune for how to configure settings.py).

npm install generate all output.
